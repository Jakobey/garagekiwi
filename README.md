This is a summary of our repo:  
 When the citizens of the desert city Los Lagos come of age, they gain the ability to transform into a particular animal species, a last gift bestowed upon them through the genetic engineering of their ancestors. It's the distant future, and humanity has crumbled from its technological marvels. There's just one problem... Los Lagos is running out of water, and the Mayor's viciously enforced Wall Laws means no-one can ever leave. Lance and his friends must do something, or the last city of humanity will perish. >>>>>>> Head
